## Concept

Any market participant can pool money and provide liquidity for traders on the platform. 
By providing liquidity, poolers would act as a counter pool where if trader wins poolers would lose vice versa.


Similar models include:
- GMX's GLP
- GainTrade's gDAI
- MUX's MUXLP
- CAP's CLP
- an AMM bot connected to an orderbook

<Note>
  Pooling is not risk free. By pooling you are becoming a market maker taking on **both** positive and negative PnL from traders. Which if the total PnL exceeds the liquidity pool, the pool will be at a total loss. Similar to any other pool based model, or market maker in traditional finance.

## Liquidity Providers


### Sample Orderflow
In order to understand the risks and benefits of becoming a liquidity provider, we must first dive into a simulated trade flow.

```
The liquidity pool has 100 USDC

Degen has 10 USDC
Degen opens a 1x leverage trade with 5 USDC
Degen is at a loss of -50% on her open trade and closes this trade to prevent further loss

Degen's total loss is 2.5 USDC which is sent to the pool for a total of 102.5 USDC & Degen is sent back 2.5 USDC to her account.
the TVL of the pool has now increased to 102.5 for a 2.5% gain for poolers socialized across all poolers.

Similarly, if Bob opens the same position shortly after and gains 2.5 USDC on his trade and closes his position in profit 
The pool loses 2.5 USDC putting it back to 100 USDC and Bob gains 7.5 USDC (5 Margin USDC + 2.5 USDC PnL)
The pool balance is now 97.5 USDC for a 2.5% loss for poolers socialized across all poolers.
```

All trading pairs with the selected collateral route through that speific pool. So all trades using USDC.e will trade against the USDC.e liquidity pool. All settled PnL is taken / given to the LP which is how liquidity providers are rewarded for their market-making.



### Why is this model used?

By providing LP you are going against the traders long term net PnL. As traders lose money then you accrue rewards however, if traders make money then the pool decreases in value which also decreases your claimable amount.

The pool has a variable withdrawal fee and lock period to prevent gaming the system.
