## Welcome

There are a few public API endpoints which can also be found open sourced on our github. We'll be covering any API that we're ready to share publicly thats made for users to also host themselves.

Check out our github repo links and run them locally.
<Note>
  If your looking to build custom API's. Let us know and we'll give you a grant!
