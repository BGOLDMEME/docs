## Overview

CinderX aims to be the one stop dapp that provide the least slippage for any swap and at the same time aggregate any other perps when our liquidity are maxed out. Most of the docs are from Unidex, so any updates/upgrades from them will be commited to us too!
In a way we are basically a frontend that manages our fees, tokenomic, treasury etc differently.

## Quick Information

### Token Information

Currently we will reward users by a point system, this is to endure sustained liquidity and trades.
The reason for this is because if we did a presale it will be very short lived. 

Supply -  NA
Circulating Supply - NA
