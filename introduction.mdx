## Overview

CinderX aims to be the one-stop shop protocol that provide the least slippage for any swap and at the same time aggregate any other perpetual protocol when our liquidity is maxed out. Our protocol manages the fees, tokenomics, and other governance differently.

## Reward System

Our platform will reward users through a points system to ensure sustained liquidity and trades. 

The more activity and liquidity there is on our platform, the more rewards that will be given away to users depending on the points that they have accumulated.
