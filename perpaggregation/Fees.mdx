## How does CinderX charge fees?

`There are no fees charged by CinderX for aggregated trades` 

There are fees charged by the underlying protocols however. For example, GMXv1 charges a 0.1% fee on every trade. CinderX does not charge any additional fees on top of this. However, CinderX does pass a referral address to collect a rebate from each aggregated order.

This lets CinderX traders both save on fees and earn a rebate on every trade by using CinderX. The rebate is currently variable based on the protocol and the size of the trade and the overall volume of our protocol.
