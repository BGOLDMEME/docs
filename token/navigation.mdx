## Usecase?

How does the platform token play into the protocol? This section will give a clear breakdown on how the token is part of the economy behind the protocol.

Protocol fees are extracted from trades and liquidations. This fee is collected and 50% is use to buyback the MOLTEN token and burn it from the circulating supply. 

15% of the fees are used to distribute it to the stakers on the chain which the user stakes.
